# Introduction to Create React App

The inception of this project utilized [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Operational Commands

Within the project directory, the following commands are executable:

### `npm start`

Operates the application in development mode.\
Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your web browser.

Automatic reloading of the page occurs when modifications are made.\
Lint errors can also be viewed in the console.

### `npm test`

Activates the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
For more details, refer to the section on [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

Compiles the application for production into the `build` folder.\
React is bundled in production mode with optimized build settings for improved performance.

The build process includes minification and appending of filenames with hashes.\
The application is now ready for deployment.

For further details, refer to the section on [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This action is irreversible. Once `eject` is performed, there is no turning back!**

In case you find the build tool and configuration options unsatisfactory, `eject` allows you to break free. This command eliminates the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it copies all configuration files and transitive dependencies (such as webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, granting you full control. All commands except `eject` remain functional but now point to the copied scripts for customization.

While `eject` is not obligatory, it provides a comprehensive feature set for small to medium deployments. Feel free to utilize this feature when ready.
